# i am now testing boolean operators now
condition1= True
condition2=False
print(not condition1)
print(condition1 and condition2)
print(condition1 or condition2)
print(not condition1 or condition2)
print(not condition1 and condition2)
# so this is the demonstration of boolean statement now in the next one we will learn about the
